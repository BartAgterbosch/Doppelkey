Simple GUI tool that let's you record keystrokes and mouse actions, and then replay them a specified number of times at a specified speed.
<br>
<br>
Simply open the tool, enter the number of repeats, then the desired speed, then press either f8 or the red record button to start recording keyboard and mouse input, and press f8 or the red record button a second time to stop recording.
To then replay the keystrokes and mouse actions, simply press f7 or the green play button.

Clicking the icon on the bottom right will take you to this Readme page

<br>
Make sure to do your due dilligence before pressing play, as there is currently no way to cancel the play loop, and you will lose keyboard and mouse control in the process, meaning you have no other option but to wait until all repeats have been performed

If you wish to compile it yourself, I suggest using the keyboard library from my repository for now instead, as the original one had an issue with the win key button for which the pull request is still open at this time
