Very simple tool that let's you record keystrokes and mouse actions, and then replay them a specified number of times at a specified speed.

Simply open the tool, enter the number of repeats, then the desired speed, then press f8 to start recording keyboard and mouse input, and press f8 to stop recording.
To then replay the keystrokes and mouse actions, simply press f7.

Fixed windows key in latest release, if you wish to build yourself then for now use keyboard library from my keyboard repo until the pull request is accepted for the original repo

When using keyboard and mouse in combination, set speed to 1 as they move out of sync
