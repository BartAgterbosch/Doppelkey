## Doppelkey #
Simple GUI tool that let's you record keystrokes and mouse actions, and then replay them a specified number of times at a specified speed.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Usage:</strong>
<br>
‣ Simply open the tool.
<br>
<br>
‣ Set the number of repeats.
<br>
‣ Set the desired speed (1 is normal).
<br>
‣ Press either f8 or the red record button to start recording keyboard and mouse input.
<br>
‣ Press f8 or the red record button a second time to stop recording.
<br>
‣ Replay the keystrokes and mouse actions by pressing f7 or the green play button.
<br>
<br>
‣ Clicking the icon on the bottom right will take you to this Readme page with the instructions.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Notes:</strong>
<br>
Make sure to do your due dilligence before pressing play, as there is currently no way to cancel the play loop, and you will lose keyboard and mouse control in the process, meaning you have no other option but to wait until all repeats have completed.
<br>
<br>
If you wish to compile it yourself, I suggest using the keyboard library from my repository for now instead of the original, as the original had an issue with the win key button for which the pull request with the fix is still open at the time of writing.
