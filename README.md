Simple GUI tool that let's you record keystrokes and mouse actions, and then replay them a specified number of times at a specified speed.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Usage:</strong>

‣ Simply open the tool.
<br>
‣ Set the number of repeats.
<br>
‣ Set the desired speed (1 is normal).

<br>
‣ Replay the keystrokes and mouse actions by pressing f7 or the green play button.
<br>
‣ Pressing f7 a second time whilst playing will cancel the play loop.

<strong>Notes:</strong>
<br>
If you wish to compile it yourself, I suggest using the keyboard library from my repository for now instead of the original, as the original had an issue with the win key button for which the pull request with the fix is still open at the time of writing.
